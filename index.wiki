== Problems ==
* Cannot see a way of getting vimwiki to process markup characters as normal
  characters (escaping). Backslashes don't appear to work.
	- vimwiki markup characters do not appear to be processed between backticks (can't even use three backticks here to express a backtick wrapped in `<code>` tags, which may be a bug) for `<code>`, or `{{{`s for `<pre>`. But what about when we don't want the text rapped in those tags?
	- Possible temporary hacks: could do something with custom LinkHandler/LinkConverter/IncludeHandler? And HTML could be included as-is with templates, but that would require separate file. All would be terrible though.

Unable to find a decent cross-platform alternative, so sticking with it for now.


== Basic commands ==

<L> = leader key (default `\`)

[count]<L>ww
	Open index file of [count]'s wiki.
	Without count, opens first wiki from |g:vimwiki_list|.

[count]<L>wt
	Open index file of [count]'s wiki in a new tab.
	
<L>ws
	List and select available wikis.


<L>wd
	Delete wiki page we're in.


<L>wr
	Rename wiki page we're in.


== Definition lists ==

{{{ 
Term 1:: Definition 1
Term 2::
:: Definition 2
:: Definition 3
}}}
