== Problems ==
* Cannot see a way of getting vimwiki to process markup characters as normal
  characters (escaping). Backslashes don't appear to work.
	- vimwiki markup characters do not appear to be processed between backticks (can't even use three backticks here to express a backtick wrapped in `<code>` tags, which may be a bug) for `<code>`, or `{{{`s for `<pre>`. But what about when we don't want the text rapped in those tags?
	- Possible temporary hacks: could do something with custom LinkHandler/LinkConverter/IncludeHandler? And HTML could be included as-is with templates, but that would require separate file. All would be terrible though.
